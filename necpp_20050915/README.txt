NEC2++ a C++ port of Numerical Electromagnetic Code
This is a free (GPL) NEC-2 compatable electromagnetic code. It can both read nec2 antenna description files (like the original) and also be incorporated into other projects like GUI tools and automatic antenna optimization systems. Nec2++ is developed on debian linux, but will work on a variety of other operating systems.
Instructions for Compiling on Windows
Versions of nec2++ since 1.2.3 now compile fine with the MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/) free compiler tools. Just download the source distribution, and follow the unix installation guide (./configure and make).
Compiling with Visual Studio 7
NEC2++ has been tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 7. A project file for VC++ 7.0 is part of the source code distribution. Visual Studio 6.0 is now supported because it does not conform to modern C++ standards.
Step-by-step instructions
1) Unzip the Windows source code distribution.
2) Build the project inside the win32 subdirectory with Visual Studio 7.
